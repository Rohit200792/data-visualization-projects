# Visualization for Data Science

These are three mini projects I completed as part of CS6630 Visualization for Data Science course Fall 2019 at the University of Utah. Technologies used consist of JavaScript, D3JS, HTML and CSS. The source code repositories have to be kept private but you can view the final visulization designs at the links below:
